Syntax: The rules for how a sentence is constructed

Semantics: The actual meaning of statements

In Python

Syntax: The rules for how each instruction is written
Semantics: The effects the instructions have

Script vs program

Script: Program with a short development cycle (Created and deployed rapidly)

Automation: The process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically

Variables: 

Containers for data.
When variable is declared your computer reserves a chunk of its own memory to store that value.

Functions

Start a function with the def keyword
Followed by the name of the function
Then we have parameters also called arguments

Returning Function values

Work that functions do can produce new results
We use the return keyword to tell python that this is the return value of a function

Comparison operators

	a == b: a is equal to b
	a != b: a is different than b
	a < b: a is smaller than b
	a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b
	a > b: a is bigger than b
	a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b


Logical Operators

	a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.
	a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False
	not a: True if a is False, False if a is True

Branching Block

if condition1:
	if-block
elif condition2:
	if-block
else:
	else-block


Anatomy of a While Loop

Code will keep executing depending on the value of a condition

Absolute Path: A full path to the resource in the file system

Relative Path: Use only a portion of a path to show where the resource is located in relation to the current
